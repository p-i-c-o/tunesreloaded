# TunesReloaded

[TunesReloaded](https://tunesreloaded.com) is a web-based classic iPod tool to add/manage songs directly, including .mp3's and .flacs. It runs entirely in the browser and uses the File System Access API to read and write directly to an iPod.

## Features

- Manage tracks and playlists from the iPod’s database
- Add/remove tracks via file picker or drag-and-drop, then sync in one batch 
- Native .flac upload support!
- Supports all legacy iPod's (with 30-pin connector, non touch)*
- Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS are all supported!
## Quickstart

1. Open [TunesReloaded](https://tunesreloaded.com) in a Chromium-based browser (Chrome / Edge).
2. Connect your iPod to your computer.
3. Grant WebUSB permission so the app can identify your iPod model (required for correct database handling).
4. Select the **root folder of the iPod drive** when prompted for file access.
5. Add songs via drag-and-drop or file picker.
6. Click **Sync** to write songs and update the iPod database!
7. Safely disconnect the iPod.


## Background

To identify the iPod model (as database encryption / writing depends on this), we use WebUSB. Then, for actually writing files/tracks to the iPod, we use the File System Access API. 

The iPod database work is powered by [`libgpod`](https://github.com/fadingred/libgpod), compiled to WebAssembly so it can parse and write the iPod’s `iTunesDB` in the browser. 

For FLAC support, the app uses [`ffmpeg.wasm`](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm) to transcode `.flac` files into ALAC-encoded files that the iPod can play.

For reduced memory usage, we stream music files directly to the iPod during sync (no full-file staging in browser memory).


## Known issues / limitations

- No support for 6th/7th gen iPod nano due to different encryption standards (Currently in development)
- No album artwork support yet
- Performance may be limited when uploading FLAC's due to high transcoding CPU usage.

If you found this tool helpful, please consider supporting development through [buying a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/riship1). I lose money on this endeavor through hosting + development costs, but I am passionate and committed to keep the new spirit of these old iPod's alive. All support is appreciated!
